My vim setup.

Currently mostly based upon: http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/

I also tried Janus: Carlhuda's vim Distribution, at https://github.com/carlhuda/janus
This worked OK on my macbook, but has a requirement for rake, the Ruby
Make-alike. Ruby isn't installed on most server OSs, so it was hard to set up
on my other machines.

USAGE:
    # Backup current setup
    mv ~/.vimrc ~/.vim
    mv ~/.vim ~/.vim.BACKUP

    # Grab project from github
    git clone git@github.com:d5ve/.vim.git
    
    # Symlink the rc file
    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

    # And we're good to go

Currently this sets up some useful shortcuts, forces you to use hjkl for
navigation, and installs a few plugins.
